## Neon

Disclosure: This is a WIP

A re-imagined browser inspired by the work of @JadenGeller in
https://github.com/JadenGeller/Helium. I'm aware of the work of HeliumLift and I
plan on implementing similar features.

Neon does not support floating, currently. It is a web view with minimum
titlebar and address bar for watching movies and tv series while retaining
screen real-estate using yabai.
